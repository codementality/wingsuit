Drupal theming without a component based solution can be very frustrating, prone to errors and hard to maintain.

It is very likely that you need to theme the same component more than once. Once you need your button inside as a field, next time you need the same button inside your node template. The solution most developer took is to copy the template and adjust them to their needs.
You distribute your component markup across the project and changes to a component must be done on several places inside your project.  

This get even more worse if you use a modern CSS framework like tailwind where everything is configured through classes directly on the element.
Using tailwind without a component based architecture can you lead to the hell.

Thinking in components makes it much easier to structure your layout. [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) or others helps you to structure your layout and makes it easier for every developer to follow the same path.    

### Presenter template
The presenter template is a drupal theme template which `includes` the component template and provides all need variables.
If you need to theme your link field with the button component you create a field template `field--field-link.html.twig` and include the button component like this:

```twig

{% 
  include "@atoms/button/button.twig" with {"text": item.content['#title'], "url": item.content['#url'].toString() }
%}
```
